Project Description

A sassy, antique-themed smart mirror website that identifies you via face recognition. If youâ€™re the owner, it showers you with sarcastic praises. If youâ€™re a strangerâ€¦ it roasts you mercilessly. Includes offline support,and a password-protected login.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People are tired of boring mirrors that silently judge them without saying a word. Whereâ€™s the drama? Whereâ€™s the sass? Whereâ€™s the passive-aggressive energy we need to start the day?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We built a digital mirror that talks back â€” literally. Using AI, it flatters its owner like theyâ€™re royalty while giving strangers a roast so spicy, they might just cry. Itâ€™s like having a stand-up comedian trapped inside a mirrorâ€¦ forever.
